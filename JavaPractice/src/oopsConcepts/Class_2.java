/* Abstract class vs Interface 
	Abstract class can have abstract and non abstract methods
	Interface can have only abstract methods (default and static also after java 8)

	Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance
	Interface support multiple inheritance

	Abstract class can have final, non final, static and non static variables
	Interface has only static and final variables

	Abstract class can have class memebers like private, protected etc 
	Interface members are public by default
